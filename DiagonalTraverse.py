1424. Diagonal Traverse II

Given a list of lists of integers, nums, return all elements of nums in diagonal order as shown in the below images.
 
Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]

Output:  [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]


A common strategy for solving a lot of programming problem is to first solve a stripped down, 
simpler version of them and then think what needs to be changed to achieve the original goal.
 Our first approach to this problem is also based on this very idea. So, instead of thinking 
 about the zig-zag pattern of printing for the diagonals, let's say the problem statement 
 simply asked us to print out the contents of the matrix, one diagonal after the other starting
 from the first element. Let's see what this problem would look like.
class Solution:
    
    def findDiagonalOrder(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        
        # Check for empty matrices
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return []
        
        # Variables to track the size of the matrix
        N, M = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        
        # The two arrays as explained in the algorithm
        result, intermediate = [], []
        
        # We have to go over all the elements in the first
        # row and the last column to cover all possible diagonals
        for d in range(N + M - 1):
            
            # Clear the intermediate array everytime we start
            # to process another diagonal
            intermediate.clear()
            
            # We need to figure out the "head" of this diagonal
            # The elements in the first row and the last column
            # are the respective heads.
            r, c = 0 if d < M else d - M + 1, d if d < M else M - 1
            
            # Iterate until one of the indices goes out of scope
            # Take note of the index math to go down the diagonal
            while r < N and c > -1:
                intermediate.append(matrix[r][c])
                r += 1
                c -= 1
            
            # Reverse even numbered diagonals. The
            # article says we have to reverse odd 
            # numbered articles but here, the numbering
            # is starting from 0 :P
            if d % 2 == 0:
                result.extend(intermediate[::-1])
            else:
                result.extend(intermediate)
        return result
