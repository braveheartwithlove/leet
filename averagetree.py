Check if a given Binary Tree is SumTree
Last Updated: 18-11-2020
Write a function that returns true if the given Binary Tree is SumTree else false. A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to the sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree. An empty tree is SumTree and sum of an empty tree can be considered as 0. A leaf node is also considered as SumTree.
Following is an example of SumTree. 
          26
        /   \
      10     3
    /    \     \
  4      6      3
  
Method 1 ( Simple ) 

Get the sum of nodes in the left subtree and right subtree. 
Check if the sum calculated is equal to the rootâ€™s data. Also,
 recursively check if the left and right subtrees are SumTrees.
# Python3 program to implement 
# the above approach
# A binary tree node has data, 
# left child and right child
class node:

	def __init__(self, x):
	
		self.data = x
		self.left = None
		self.right = None

# A utility function to get the sum
# of values in tree with root as root 
def sum(root):

	if(root == None):
		return 0
	return (sum(root.left) +
			root.data +
			sum(root.right))

# returns 1 if sum property holds 
# for the given node and both of 
# its children 

# Computes the number of nodes in tree 
def size(node): 
    if node is None: 
        return 0 
    else: 
        return (size(node.left)+ 1 + size(node.right)) 

		
def isAvgTree(node):

	# ls, rs

	# If node is None or it's a leaf 
	# node then return true
	if(node == None or
	(node.left == None and
	node.right == None)):
		return 1

	# Get sum of nodes in left and 
	# right subtrees 
	ls = sum(node.left)
	rs = sum(node.right)
	size_left = size(node.left)
	size_right = size(node.right)
	
	# if the node and both of its children
	# satisfy the property return 1 else 0
	if((node.data == (ls + rs)/(size_left+size_right)) and
		isAvgTree(node.left) and
		isAvgTree(node.right)):
		return 1

	return 0		
	
def isSumTree(node):

	# ls, rs

	# If node is None or it's a leaf 
	# node then return true
	if(node == None or
	(node.left == None and
	node.right == None)):
		return 1

	# Get sum of nodes in left and 
	# right subtrees 
	ls = sum(node.left)
	rs = sum(node.right)

	# if the node and both of its children
	# satisfy the property return 1 else 0
	if((node.data == ls + rs) and
		isSumTree(node.left) and
		isSumTree(node.right)):
		return 1

	return 0
