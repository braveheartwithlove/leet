825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages
Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and ages[i] is the age of the ith person. 

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7
age[B] > age[A]
age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100
Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?

Example 1:

Input: [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
Example 2:

Input: [16,17,18]
Output: 2
Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.

class Solution {
    public int numFriendRequests(int[] ages) {
        int res = 0;
        Arrays.sort(ages);
        for (int i = 0; i < ages.length; ++i) {
            int age = ages[i];
            int lower = firstIdx(ages, age/2+7);
            int upper = firstIdx(ages, age);
            res += Math.max(upper-lower-1, 0);
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    private static int firstIdx(int[] ages, int target) {
        int beg = 0;
        int end = ages.length-1;
        while (beg <= end) {
            int mid = beg + (end-beg)/2;
            if (ages[mid] <= target) beg = mid + 1;
            else end = mid - 1;
        }
        return beg;
    }
}


Approach #1: Counting [Accepted]
class Solution {
    public int numFriendRequests(int[] ages) {
        int[] count = new int[121];
        for (int age: ages) count[age]++;

        int ans = 0;
        for (int ageA = 0; ageA <= 120; ageA++) {
            int countA = count[ageA];
            for (int ageB = 0; ageB <= 120; ageB++) {
                int countB = count[ageB];
                if (ageA * 0.5 + 7 >= ageB) continue;
                if (ageA < ageB) continue;
                if (ageA < 100 && 100 < ageB) continue;
                ans += countA * countB;
                if (ageA == ageB) ans -= countA;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
